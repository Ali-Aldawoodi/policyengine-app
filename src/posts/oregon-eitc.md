# Computing your Oregon Earned Income Tax Credit in PolicyEngine

We walk you through it step by step.

The federal earned income tax credit (EITC) is accrued through working and it functions to lower one’s tax liability. The EITC is _refundable_, meaning if one’s tax liability is reduced below zero, then the taxpayer will receive income back in the form of a refund. [Oregon is one of 29 states](https://www.taxcreditsforworkersandfamilies.org/state-tax-credits/) that provides a match or similar program to the federal EITC.

Oregon’s EITC has two elements. The first gives 12% of the federal EITC to filers with children under three years old. For filers without young children, Oregon matches 9% of the federal EITC.

We’ve now modeled Oregon’s EITC match in PolicyEngine, along with other credits and subtractions. The below video outlines an example of how to estimate your EITC match in Oregon under current law. You can also read on in this blog post for step by step instructions on entering your information and estimating your own credit.

In this example, we’ll consider a single parent with $30,000 employment income and two children, aged two and four, respectively. By the end, you’ll see how much they are eligible for from the Oregon EITC in 2022. You can also enter information about your own household instead.

First, select Your Household on the top bar to enter information about you and other members of your household.

Then, on to the Demographics tab to enter the ages of the children, since the Oregon EITC varies with age. Using the person dropdown menu, enter the age of Your first dependent as 2 and Your second dependent as 4.

Clicking through each highlighted tab, we come to the Oregon EITC of $490. That is, a single parent with $30,000 employment income and children aged two and four will receive $490 from the Oregon EITC in 2022.
