[Oregon created the nonrefundable exemption credit in 1983](https://www.oregon.gov/dor/programs/gov-research/Documents/Oregon%20Personal%20Exemption%20Credits.pdf), when it replaced the personal exemption deduction. From 1987 on, the state has indexed the credit to inflation. As a nonrefundable credit, its value is capped at one’s tax liability. Single and married filing separately statuses can claim the credit if their income does not exceed $100,000. For other statuses, the income cap is $200,000. Eligible filers can claim a $213 credit (2021) for themselves, their spouse, and any dependents in the household. They can also claim additional exemptions if the filer or their spouse is severely disabled, or if they have a disabled child.

Using PolicyEngine, we can compute the exemption credit’s impact. We’ll do this by comparing a policy regime without Oregon’s exemption credit to one with it.

From the Policy page, navigate to the Oregon > State income tax > Credits > Exemption credit section. Select the Baseline, and set the value of OR exemption amount to zero. [This will produce this reform link.](https://policyengine.org/us/population-impact?or_exemption_credit_amount=213&baseline_or_exemption_credit_amount=0&baseline_state_specific=OR)

By default, the Reform will show the current value of $213.

Now click Compute population impact. This runs the no-exemption-credit policy and current policy through the 2021 Current Population Survey March Supplement, which includes about 1,400 Oregon households.¹

We estimate that Oregon’s exemption credit cost $639 million in 2021, reduced poverty 3%, and benefited 81% of the population. As a comparison, Oregon estimates that the credit cost about $650 million in 2021.²

Now let’s see how the exemption credit affects specific Oregon households. To see how to define a household, see our [post on the Oregon Earned Income Tax Credit](https://medium.com/policyengine/computing-your-oregon-earned-income-tax-credit-in-policyengine-d911ae29749d).

For a family of four (married with two children) with $100,000 in employment income, the exemption credit lowers taxes by $852 ($213 \ 4).

Select Compute how earnings affect you to see how the exemption credit affects this household’s net income. Then select the Difference button to generate the below chart. The credit’s value phases in due to the credit’s nonrefundability; the household has to earn at least $19,500 to receive the full credit value. The credit’s cliff at $200K in employment income results from the income cap.

The credit reduces a joint filer’s marginal tax rate by up to 6.7 percentage points as it phases in, and then produces a spike at the cliff.

We will update the exemption credit’s value when Oregon releases 2022 tax forms.

¹ The CPS March Supplement has about 100,000 households, and Oregon has about 1.4% of the US population.

² In the 2021–2023 period, [Oregon’s biennial tax expenditure report](https://www.oregon.gov/dor/programs/gov-research/Documents/TE2123-Final.pdf#page=200) shows a revenue impact of $4.6 million for the child with disability credit (p.144), $4.5 million for the severe disability credit (p.149), and $1,308,900,000 for the personal exemption credit (p.200). $1.318 billion divided by 2 (tax years 2021 and 2022) is $659 million.
