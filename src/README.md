PolicyEngine React commandments:

- All components must be functional components.
- No React.Context (unless _absolutely_ necessary).
- Add _at least_ a docstring to every component.
- Add graceful error handling to every component. Don't assume that the data you're getting is correct.
- Add new rules to this list as you begin to follow them.
- Keep functions less than 150 lines after formatting.
